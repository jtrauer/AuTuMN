This directory saves temporary data files in csv format for 
philippines calibration targets

Data on notifications, icu occupancy, and deaths are downloaded 
from two different google drive folders using the fetch_phl_data() 
function in scripts.phl_data_upload.py
The shareable links need to be updated each time there is new 
data available to process.
This function deletes the zip file downloaded, the other files 
get removed from this folder using the process_phl_data function

The original data is formatted for use in the covid-19 model using 
using the process_phl_data function in scripts.phl_data_upload.py
This function produces three temporary files named 
PHL_deaths_processessed.csv
PHL_icu_processed.csv
PHL_notifications_processed.csv
These files get replaced whenever this function is run with new data.

The update_calibration_phl() function in scripts.phl_data_upload uses
the processed datasets stored in this directory to to update the 
json target files for each philippines region.
